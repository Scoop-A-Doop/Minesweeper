# Minesweeper
A recreation of classic minesweeper made in C#

This repo contains all files related to the program. 

By running this in an IDE, it will open up a GUI and starts a game of minesweeper. Users are able to select on cells to reveal whether that cell was a mine or not. The user's time to complete the board is also recorded at the bottom. Upon winning or losing the game, the program updates the users win-loss record and can be accessed from the drop down menu on the top. Upon winning a game, if the user completes it in record time, then their fastest time is also saved, being able to be accessed from the drop down menu on the top.
